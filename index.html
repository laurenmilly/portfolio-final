              <h2>My Digital Literacy Narrative</h2>
              <h5>Last Updated, Dec 18, 2020</h5>
              <p>I had the typical experiences of my generation with computers and media in the late 90’s to early 2000’s with the Oregon Trail, Clippy in Microsoft, AOL messenger, MySpace and my life long addiction to The Sims. However, one of my strongest memories of working with a computer was setting up our printer because my dad got frustrated with the instructions. This later morphed into me setting up a PC for my grandmother and helping her learn how to use the computer and email so she could keep in touch with her friends. </p>
              <p>Later in high school I became the primary bookkeeper for my father’s business, by making sure all of his records were kept on electronic files for tax purposes. I used the training from my primary and secondary schooling to manage this and teach my father, who had no formal technical training, along the way. I didn’t realize it at the time, because using computers and the internet seemed natural for me, and I wouldn’t realize it until I was in the workforce, but this laid the ground for my interest in technical communication.</p>
              <p>When I went to college for my undergraduate, I never really thought about getting a degree with computers, I thought it far to analytical for me at the time. So I finally settled on a degree in English with a minor in Communications. I quickly realized that the communications studies were far more applicable to the work place than reading Shakespeare.</p>
              <p>However, as I entered the workforce and starting rising through the ranks at a SAAS company, I saw that the critical thinking skills I learned through my English degree as well as my communication skills were something that not everyone had. I was able to succeed because I could search through our tools (Jira, Sharepoint, Confluence, network drives) or ask the right questions of my colleagues to find the information I needed to solve an issue or communicate effectively. I was able to succeed in my career because I understood how to communicate complex, technical information to the average person. I followed the same process as when I was a kid; I learned the information myself and then boiled it down into the needed information to send along to my clients, like teaching my dad.</p>
              <p>I then moved into a more technical position, where it was my responsibility to create custom XML, 834, or API integrations and documentation. I’ve relied heavily upon my mentors, coworkers, and employer lead training to teach me how to correctly and effectively create and document these integrations.</p>
              <p>This made me recognize that I would benefit from some formal training in this sphere as almost everything thing I know about the technical side is from my work experiences, which is very specific to those products, and is mainly self-taught.</p>
              <h3>My Private Learning Network Version 1:</h3>
              <img src="images/pln v1.png" width="800" height="800">
              <p>Throughout WRIT 5662 this semester I’ve learned various things I would have not otherwise had the opportunity to – primarily the tools technical communicators utilize, but also the processes technical communicators use. I would have never taken the initiative to learn HTML, CSS, and how to host static sites, but I’ve learned all about those tools and processes. I found GitHub to be especially interesting, because it is not something I’ve had any experience with but I can see how it can directly correlate to a technical communicators job as well as my own current position as a business analyst. In my job experience I’ve had to collaborate and coordinate with various teams, including engineering, and learning about GitHub and how teams use it – I was able to see how it could improve the development lifecycle of products at my own company. </p>
              <p>The client project we worked on was also enlightening about the tools and processes technical communicators use on a daily basis. Learning how to do wireframes was probably my favorite part of this course. Wireframing allowed me to bring creativity into my work in a more visual way than CSS/coding. I enjoyed hearing my teammates visions, how they related to our client and desired audience and ultimately creating the wireframes. This made me realize that I actually do enjoy the design aspect more than I realized, and has given me food for thought on where I would like to grow my career. I also really enjoyed designing something for one specific client and audience. Most of my work has been on software that services multiple clients with similar but not exact needs, so it is a balance of finding that lowest common denominator sometimes. However, with our client project we were able to tailor our design and ideas to our specific client and their audience, which was really interesting and engaging.</p>
              <p>Markdown was really quite easy to learn, but I struggled with understanding how it would directly tie into my current work or how I could utilize it in the future. However, DITA is probably the most directly relevant to my current work out of all the tools we learned this semester. So much so, I picked a project that I’ve been working on learning at my new job as my DITA project – it fit that well! Additionally, DITA is almost what I most think of when I think of technical writing. While I don’t think my current job/position will embrace DITA specifically, I know that I can take the principles I’ve learned from working in DITA and apply them to my work moving forward, in particular creating modular and reusable content. </p>
              <p>Ultimately throughout this semester I’ve learned various tools and processes that I had no previous knowledge of. While some of them can be directly tied to my current career they have also given me something to think about in regards to the future of my career path. I’ve learned some basics about HTML, CSS, and hosting static sites, but expect that is not where I’ll focus my future learning experiences on. I’ve learned that I enjoy visual design aspects but also creating reusable content. Knowing what I do not want to focus my time on has always helped me focus on other areas, which then help me land on what topic I do want to focus on and WRIT 5662 has helped me do that!</p>
